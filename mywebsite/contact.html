                    All these artist outdid themselves in their era and were the cream of the crop in the 80s.
                    Artist such as Micheal Jackson are still being played to this day and viewed as the all time greats.
                    Micheal Jackson in particular went on to inspire some of the most popular artists today such as Justin Beiber and The Weeknd.
                    All four of these artist became philanthropist and even U2 went on to be more popular for their philanthropy than for their music.
                    we look back on all these artist as people who set the playing field for modern hip hop and pop.
